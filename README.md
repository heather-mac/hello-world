# hello-world
Just Another Repository is actually THE DESCRIPTION given to my Very First Ever
Repository ... and that first ever repo's name is Hello World, 
in its MASTER file form. But a BRANCH (of the MASTER) has now been created
for (telling of) making changes or edits without 'mucking up' the record of the
original MASTER. This 'experimental' BRANCH has been named, simply,
as (the) "readme-edits" (branched copy of) "master."
